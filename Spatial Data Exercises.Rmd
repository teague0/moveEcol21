# Reading, Visualizaing, and Manipulating Spatial Data in R

We've gone over some of the aspects of spatial data in R. Now we are going to demonstrate how to *sf* and *tidyverse* libraries together to manipulate spatial **vector** data. 

---
# Step 1. Set up our environment and read in the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(mapview)
```

---

# *sf* objects in R

*sf* objects usually have two classes - *sf* and `data.frame`.
Two main differences comparing to a regular `data.frame` object are 
spatial metadata (`geometry type`, `dimension`, `bbox`, `epsg (SRID)`, 
`proj4string`) and additional column - typically named `geom` or `geometry`.

Today we are going to play with shapefiles of Hong Kong's administrative boundaries
downloaded from the [global administrative areas database](http://www.gadm.org/download)
and provided for you in the `data` directory. 

---
# Read in data

Now let's use the `st_read` function to read both files in separately. Note that 
within the *sf* library most commands begin with the "st" prefix. We can then do a quick plot of one of them

```{r}
boundary_path <- "data/HK_boundary.shp"
district_path <- "data/HK_districts.shp"
HK_boundary <- st_read(boundary_path)
HK_districts <- st_read(district_path)
plot(HK_boundary)
```
---

# Attributes of *sf* objects

Just for kicks, prove to yourself that a sf object is just a fancy data.frame:
check out the class structure of *sf* objects

```{r}
class(HK_boundary)
```

Because of their dual class structure: *sf* objects can be used as a regular 
`data.frame` object in many operations. For instance, we can call simple data.frame
operations like `nrow` or `names` on these objects.

```{r}
nrow(HK_districts)
ncol(HK_districts)
names(HK_districts)
```

---

# Dataframes & geometry?

If we are ever curious about just the dataframe or just the geometry separately, 
we can use `st_geometry` commands.  By setting the geometry to 'NULL' using `st_set_geometry`, an *sf* object returns to a simple *data.frame*. Calling the `st_geometry` from an *sf* object would extract just the spatial attributes turning this into a "simple feature collection" or *sfc*.   

To turn an *sfc* object back into an *sf* object use `st_sf()`.

```{r}
#NOTE: None of these changes are permanent since they are not assigned ( <- ) to an object
HK_boundary %>% class # complete sf object

HK_boundary %>% st_set_geometry(NULL) %>% class  # force to data.frame

HK_boundary %>% st_geometry() %>% class  # extract only the spatial info, force to "sfc"
```

---

# Step 2: Visualize

.pull-left[

Let's take a look at our shapefiles, make sure they look like we expect. We can do this in 2 ways:
1. Base R using `plot`
2. *sf* by pulling geometry & plotting
]

.pull-right [
Run the following code to see how these methods differ
```
# look what happens when we use generic plot on the whole dataframe
HK_districts %>% plot

# pull just the geometry
HK_boundary %>% st_geometry() %>% plot
HK_districts %>% st_geometry() %>% plot

# or pull just one column
plot(HK_districts["NAME_1"])
```
]

---
# Base R plot

```{r, warning=FALSE}
HK_districts %>% plot
```
---

# Pull geometry only & plot
.pull-left[

```{r, warning=FALSE}
HK_boundary %>% st_geometry() %>% plot
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r, warning=FALSE}
HK_districts %>% st_geometry() %>% plot
```
]
---

# Pull just one column

```{r}
plot(HK_districts["NAME_1"])
```
---

# Plotting With *ggplot*

*ggplot2* now has integrated functionality to plot sf objects using `geom_sf()`.

```{r}
#simplest plot
ggplot(HK_districts) + geom_sf()
```

This is useful to make sure your file looks correct but doesn't display any information about the data. 

---

# Plotting With *ggplot*

We can plot these regions and fill each polygon based on the rgn_id.

```{r}
ggplot(HK_districts) + geom_sf(aes(fill = NAME_1))
```

---

# Getting fancy with Mapview


*ggplot* gives us useful defaults like Latitude and Longitude labels and cleaner legends but
there are even fancier things we can do with maps. We'll introduce you to one in
the *mapview* library below where we can get interactive maps.  *mapview* is a wrapper for the *leaflet* package. Leaflet is a visualization engine written in javascript that is widely used to make and embed interactive plots. 

---

# Getting fancy with Mapview

```{r, screenshoot.force=TRUE}
library(mapview)

map <- mapview(HK_districts) #create a mapview object of the district boundaries
points <- st_sample(HK_districts, 25) #sample out 25 of the district cities

pointsRed <- mapview(points, cex=3, color="red") #create a mapview object of the cities. Color them red
map+pointsRed #now plot the maps together

```


---

# Step 3: Manipulate!

An important advantage of simple features in R is that their structure makes it 
easy to use the *dplyr* package on *sf* objects:

For instance, taking standard examples we've introduced:

`select()`

```{r select}

HK_trim <- HK_boundary %>%
  select(ID_0, ISO, NAME_LO, SOVEREI, FIPS, ISON, POP2000, SQKM)

HK_trim
```
---

#Step 3: Manipulate!

`mutate()` & `pull()`

What is the population per square kilometer? 

```{r mutate}
HK_trim %>%
  mutate(POP_per_SQKM = POP2000/SQKM) %>% pull(POP_per_SQKM)
```


---

#Step 3: Manipulate!

`filter()`

Only plot a few districts
```{r filter}

HK_districts %>%
  filter(NAME_1 %in% c("Eastern", "North", "Islands")) %>% 
  ggplot(.) + geom_sf(aes(fill = NAME_1))
```


---

# Spatial operations

You can merge all polygons into one using `st_union()`.
```{r st_union}

full_rgn  <- st_union(HK_districts)

plot(full_rgn)
```

---

# Joins

Perhaps we had some points -- locations of animal observations maybe -- and we 
wanted to join them to data in a different layer like US states. *sf* and *dplyr* make this doable.

Below we join the randomly sampled points from above to the HK_districts layer, to pull the relevant district information (like it's name) for each point. 

```
st_sf(points) %>% st_join(., HK_districts)
```


---

# Summarizing

From there it is simple to use `group_by` and `tally` (a wrapper for the more general `summarise` function) to count how many points we sampled in each district:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
st_sf(points) %>% 
  st_join(., HK_districts) %>%
  group_by(NAME_1) %>% 
  tally()
```

---


--- 

# Homework
.pull-left[
Remember this map from above? Make this map pretty using the package *tmap* and add in the points we've selected out above. Refer back to the Spatial Data in R lecture and the New Zealand maps and change something about this map. Maybe make background blue? Maybe give it a title? Maybe you want a different color palette?

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(HK_districts) + geom_sf(aes(fill = NAME_1))
```
]

.pull-right[
Here is some code to get you started

```
library(tmap)
tm_shape(HK_districts)+
  tm_polygons(col = " ")+
```
]
